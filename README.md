# KTUG-ChessBot
A Chessboard made for KTU Gymnasium Chess Engine tournament.

To run, open the dist folder and use run.exe to launch the program.

The code is currently being updated, fixed, refactored for easier use. There will also be multipe versions of the exe uploaded to allow for human interaction. Human interaction is already implemented, however it is disabled to focus on connecting chess engines. If you are able to, you can edit the run.py file to enable human mode (will need to also remove all references to sockets and the like).
